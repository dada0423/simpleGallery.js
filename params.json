  "body": "## Why\r\n\r\nUpload, surely, is a hard part in programming, probably you have had problems with that. Why not simplify? No frameworks, just 2kb gzipped!\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"//jsfiddle.net/fccoelho7/3ffx68fo/2/embedded/result/\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n## Flow\r\n\r\nWhen you send images and is returned a JSON data, it is saved in hidden input value. Same occurs when you edit title, reorder and remove images. After all actions, you just need to save that JSON in your database submitting the form.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nTo reorder gallery, is required [Sortable](https://github.com/RubaXa/Sortable), \"a minimalist JavaScript library\".\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nYou can get it on npm.\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install simple-gallery-js --save-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr bower, too.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbower install simple-gallery-js --save-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're not into package management, just [download a ZIP](https://github.com/fccoelho7/simpleGallery.js/archive/master.zip) file.\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nFirst, include the script located on the `dist` folder.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"dist/simple-gallery.min.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, you need to instantiate it.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnew SimpleGallery('.form-upload');\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\nWhen you upload images, your server needs to return a JSON data like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  [{ \"url\": \"http://../image1.jpg\" }, { \"url\": \"http://../image2.jpg\" }, ..]\r\n```\r\n\r\nEvery data will be saved into a value of any hidden input, by default:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"gallery\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nLastly, you also need to create a div that will contain the gallery.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n  <div class=\"gallery-container\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are not happy with default, change it!\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// 1. Form container.\r\n// 2. Name of hidden input that will receive gallery data.\r\n// 3. Gallery container.\r\n\r\nnew SimpleGallery('.form-upload', 'gallery', '.gallery-container');\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Cheat\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<form class=\"form-upload\" action=\"/\" method=\"POST\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\">\r\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"gallery\">\r\n  <label>Image Gallery</label>\r\n  <div class=\"input-upload btn\">\r\n    Upload\r\n    <input class=\"upload\" type=\"file\" multiple=\"multiple\" accept=\"image/*\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"gallery-container\"></div>\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Advanced Options\r\n\r\nIf you don't want use same URL for upload images, add a `data-action-gallery`.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<form class=\"form-upload\" action=\"/\" method=\"POST\" data-action-gallery='/upload' enctype=\"multipart/form-data\"></form>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Browser Support\r\n\r\n| Chrome | Firefox | IE | Opera | Safari |\r\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\r\n| 29+ ✔ | 46+ ✔ | 11+ ✔ | Nope ✘ | 9.1+ ✘ |\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT LICENSE\r\n\r\nCopyright 2016-2016 Fabio Carvalho fccoelho7@gmail.com\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
